## 🎯 About This Portfolio

This website represents the intersection of technical skill and creative expression. The dual-nature design reflects my belief that the best engineers are also artists, and the most impactful technology comes from those who can think both analytically and creatively.

The professional side demonstrates technical competence, while the creative side reveals the passion and personality behind the code. Together, they tell the complete story of a software engineer who builds not just functional systems, but experiences that matter.
